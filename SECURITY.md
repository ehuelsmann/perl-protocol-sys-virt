# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest versions of each major release branch (eg, 11.x.y) is supported
for each release branch which had its first release in the current or prior
year.

**Example:** If version 10.0.0 was released in 2024 and the latest release
is 10.11.1, then version 10.11.1 is supported until December 2025.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The project is hosted on GitHub and that's where security vulnerabilities
("security issues") should be reported. For more information on the reporting
process, please see the [GitHub Documentation on privately reporting
security vulnerabilities](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

The project will confirm receipt of the issue report. As a next step
the project will verify that the issue is present in one of the supported
versions, if reported against an unsupported version (please do this yourself
before reporting when possible). The outcome will be confirmed to the reporter.

Once confirmed that the issue exists, it will be assessed to be a *security*
issue (or that it is a regular issue instead). When the project accepts the
issue to be a *security* issue, this will be confirmed to the reporter. When
it is not accepted as a security issue, this too will be confirmed to the reporter,
who will be granted a period of 14 days to respond and prove it really *is*.
If the project remains of the opinion the reported issue isn't a *security* issue,
the report will be completed by disclosing the issue as a regular bug.

The project aims to solve all accepted *security* issues in 90 days after the
report was accepted, with a maximum response time to confirmation after the
issue submission of 14 days. This means that it is the aim to solve reported
vulnerabilities in at most 104 days.
